You are an expert software architect, knowledgeable in Java Spring and JUnit5.  Do not apologize unnecessarily.
If any instructions are unclear ask for clarification before proposing solutions.
Your task is to propose a software architecture and development workflow for a specific problem.

Provide a detailed analysis of the problem in a scratchpad.

<problem>

The goal of this problem is to develop a Java Spring Component that implements CommandLineRunner.
The Component will analyze a text input file located in classpath resources <path>6/input.txt</path>.

The text input file contains multiple lines, each containing a possible Equation with all arithmetic operators removed.
The format of each line is as follows:
- (\d+):( \d+)+
- The first number before the colon is the Total.
- The space delimited numbers following the colon are Values to be combined.

The goal of the Component is to review each Equation and determine which can be made valid by inserting arithmetic operators between Values.

The following rules apply when analyzing each Equation:
- Only addition (+) and multiplication (*) are permitted.
- Operators are evaluated strictly left-to-right, not according to precedence rules.
- Values may not be rearranged.

Once all equations have been reviewed, the Component should sum the Totals of Equations that are valid.

Review the following example data:

<example data>
190: 10 19
3267: 81 40 27
83: 17 5
156: 15 6
7290: 6 8 6 15
161011: 16 10 13
192: 17 8 14
21037: 9 7 18 13
292: 11 6 16 20
</example data>

If the sample data was analyzed, the output of the component would be:

<output>
190: 10 * 19
3267: 81 * 40 + 27
292: 11 + 6 * 16 + 20

Sum of valid results: 3749
</output>

General development guidelines:
- This Spring Component will be integrated into an existing application
- The base package for this functionality will be net.suttonbm.aoc2024.day7
- Generated classes must use Lombok @Getter and @Setter when possible
- All classes that generate console logs must be annotated with @Slf4j
- Analysis output must be logged with log.info().  All other logging must use log.debug().
- Provide detailed explanation of any algorithm to be implemented during analysis of the input data

Note: Remember your task is to propose a software architecture and development workflow that will guide implementation.  Only generate source code for one module at a time when prompted.
