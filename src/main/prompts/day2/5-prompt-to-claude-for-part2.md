**Objective:** Enhance the existing implementation to evaluate whether removing a single number from an unsafe report makes it safe.

**Code Requirements:**
1. Modify the `ReportSafetyAnalyzer` class to:
    - Identify unsafe reports after the initial safety analysis.
    - For each unsafe report, iterate through the numbers and check if removing one number makes the sequence safe.
    - Log the original unsafe report, the number removed, and the resulting safe sequence.
2. Add a method `isSingleRemovalSafe` in `SafetyCheckService` to:
    - Accept a sequence and iterate through it.
    - Remove each number one at a time, checking the remaining sequence for safety.
    - Return true if any single-removal sequence is safe, and the number removed.
3. Ensure changes adhere to clean coding practices and test thoroughly.

**Testing:**
- Test cases for reports that become safe after a single removal, those that remain unsafe, and edge cases such as very small sequences.

Example Input:
```
Reports: 
[1, 3, 2, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 3, 7, 10]
```

Expected Output:
- Total safe reports: `1`.
- Unsafe report `[1, 3, 2, 4]` becomes safe by removing `2`: `[1, 3, 4]`.
- Report `[1, 3, 7, 10]` remains unsafe.

<requirements>
- Add functionality to evaluate single-removal safeness for unsafe reports.
- Ensure existing safe reports are not modified.
- Maintain separation of concerns between parsing, validation, and analysis.
- Log or return all reports and their classifications, including modifications made for single-removal safeness.
