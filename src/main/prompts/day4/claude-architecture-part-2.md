<problem>
The goal of this problem is to develop a Java Spring Component that implements CommandLineRunner to analyze a text input file located in class path resources.

The text input file describes a crossword puzzle.  The puzzle consists of multiple lines of text, where each line is a series of characters.  The total content represents a rectangular matrix of characters.

When run, the Spring Component should analyze the input data and count the number of times a specified sub-matrix appears.  A valid sub-matrix match must meet the following requirements:

- Null characters (\0) in the sub-matrix are considered to match any character in the input.
- Non-null characters in the sub-matrix must match exactly.
- The sub matrix be rotated or flipped to match the input.
- Matches may overlap with other matches as long as the above rules are followed.

Consider the following example input data:

<data>

MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX

</data>

For the example sub-matrix below, the resulting count is 9:

<sub-matrix>
M S
 A 
M S
</sub-matrix>

To illustrate the solution, the following solution text has replaced any character not included in a match for the sub-matrix with “.”:

<solution text>

.M.S......
..A..MSMS.
.M.S.MAA..
..A.ASMSM.
.M.S.M....
..........
S.S.S.S.S.
.A.A.A.A..
M.M.M.M.M.
..........

</solution text>

The solution will be integrated into an existing Spring module.  Review the attached context and propose what additional modules are needed to accomplish the task.

Note: Remember your task is not to propose source code to solve the problem.  Your task is to propose a software architecture and development workflow that will guide implementation.
